  - Create API endpoints for user registration and login, storing hashed passwords in MySQL database.
  - Protect admin routes to ensure only authenticated users can access photo management features.
- **Notes:** Use bcrypt for password hashing and middleware to verify JWTs. AI can assist in generating authentication boilerplate.

### Day 4: Admin Panel Interface
- **Goal:** Build a user interface for photo management.
- **Tasks:**
  - Design and implement the admin login page with a simple form (username, password).
  - Develop the admin dashboard with forms for uploading photos, editing metadata, and deleting photos, using React components and Tailwind CSS.
  - Integrate the dashboard with backend APIs for real-time photo management.
- **Notes:** Use React Dropzone for drag-and-drop uploads. Ensure the UI is intuitive and secure.

### Day 5: Frontend Development - Static Pages
- **Goal:** Create the Home and About pages to establish the site’s structure.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement the Home page with a hero section featuring a striking photo or slideshow, a brief introduction, and links to portfolio categories.
  - Build the About page with your bio, photography style, and service details.
  - Ensure both pages are responsive and use Tailwind CSS for an edgy, dark-themed design (e.g., black background, neon accents).
- **Notes:** Add meta tags and alt texts for SEO and accessibility. Use AI to generate responsive layouts quickly.

### Day 6: Frontend Development - Portfolio Page
- **Goal:** Develop the core photo gallery feature.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a responsive grid layout for photo thumbnails using a library like React Photo Gallery.
  - Implement filtering by category (Concerts, Cars, Nature) with dynamic updates.
  - Integrate with backend APIs to fetch and display photos from MySQL database and S3.
- **Notes:** Ensure the grid adapts to mobile screens. Test API integration to verify photo retrieval.

### Day 7: Frontend Development - Contact and Gallery Enhancements
- **Goal:** Complete frontend features with the Contact page and advanced gallery functionality.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement the Contact page with a functional form (name, email, subject, message) that sends inquiries to an API endpoint.
  - Add a lightbox feature for viewing full-size images with titles and descriptions using React Lightbox.
  - Enhance the gallery with search or additional filter options (e.g., by tags).
- **Notes:** Use a library like emailjs for form submissions if a backend email service isn’t set up. Optimize image loading with lazy loading.

### Day 8: Quality Assurance
- **Goal:** Ensure the website is functional and reliable.
- **Tasks:**
  - Write unit tests for API endpoints using a framework like Jest to verify CRUD operations and authentication.
  - Perform integration tests for frontend components to ensure API interactions work as expected.
  - Conduct manual testing of user flows (e.g., photo upload, gallery filtering, form submission).
- **Notes:** Use AI to generate test cases, but review for accuracy. Document any issues for resolution.

### Day 9: Cross-Platform Testing and Optimization

# To-Do List for MTP Collective Photography Website

## Introduction
This to-do list outlines all tasks required to build a custom photography website for MTP Collective (or Monkey Take Photo), showcasing your concert, car, and nature photography. The list is designed for a single developer, aligning with the 10-day development plan and Product Requirements Document (PRD). It ensures the website is responsive, edgy, and built from scratch using modern web technologies (React, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS S3) with AI-assisted coding. Tasks are organized by phase, with dependencies considered to streamline development.

## To-Do List

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Day 1)
- [ ] Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript support.
- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
- [ ] Set up a Git repository and make the initial commit.
- [ ] Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a database.
- [ ] Define MongoDB schemas for photos (ID, title, description, category, tags, file URL, thumbnail URL), categories (ID, name, description), and users (ID, username, password, role).
- [ ] Install dependencies (mongoose, aws-sdk, sharp).
- [ ] Verify AWS account setup for S3 integration.
- [ ] Write a README with project setup instructions.

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Day 2)
- [ ] Create API routes for photo CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Next.js API routes.
- [ ] Implement photo upload functionality to AWS S3 with automatic thumbnail generation using sharp.
- [ ] Store photo metadata (title, description, category, tags) in MongoDB upon upload.
- [ ] Test API endpoints using Postman to ensure correct responses.
- [ ] Add basic error handling for API routes (e.g., invalid file types, missing fields).
- [ ] Document API endpoints in the README.

### Phase 3: Authentication Implementation (Day 3)
- [ ] Install dependencies for JWT authentication (jsonwebtoken, bcrypt).
- [ ] Create API endpoints for user registration and login, storing hashed passwords in MongoDB.
- [ ] Implement middleware to protect admin routes with JWT verification.
- [ ] Test authentication endpoints to ensure secure access.
- [ ] Add basic password validation (e.g., minimum length) to registration.

### Phase 4: Admin Panel Interface (Day 4)
- [ ] Create a login page with a form for username and password, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- [ ] Build the admin dashboard with sections for photo upload, metadata editing, and deletion.
- [ ] Integrate React Dropzone for drag-and-drop photo uploads.
- [ ] Connect the dashboard to backend APIs for photo management.
- [ ] Test admin panel functionality, ensuring uploads and edits reflect in MongoDB and S3.
- [ ] Add basic input validation (e.g., required fields) to the upload form.

### Phase 5: Frontend Development - Static Pages (Day 5)
- [ ] Design the Home page with a hero section (photo or slideshow), intro text, and category links.
- [ ] Style the Home page with a dark theme, neon accents, and bold typography (e.g., Montserrat).
- [ ] Create the About page with bio, photography style, and service details.
- [ ] Ensure both pages are responsive using Tailwind CSS media queries.
- [ ] Add meta tags and alt texts for SEO and accessibility on both pages.
- [ ] Test page layouts on mobile and desktop devices.

### Phase 6: Frontend Development - Portfolio Page (Day 6)
- [ ] Install React Photo Gallery for a responsive thumbnail grid.
- [ ] Create the Portfolio page with category filters (Concerts, Cars, Nature).
- [ ] Integrate with backend APIs to fetch photos from MongoDB and S3.
- [ ] Implement dynamic filtering to update the grid based on category selection.
- [ ] Ensure the grid is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- [ ] Test API integration and filtering functionality.

### Phase 7: Frontend Development - Contact and Gallery Enhancements (Day 7)
- [ ] Create the Contact page with a form (name, email, subject, message) styled with Tailwind CSS.
- [ ] Set up form submission using an API endpoint or a library like emailjs.
- [ ] Install React Lightbox for full-size image views with title and description.
- [ ] Add a search bar or tag-based filtering to the Portfolio page.
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for gallery images to improve performance.
- [ ] Test form submission and lightbox functionality across devices.

### Phase 8: Quality Assurance (Day 8)
- [ ] Install Jest for unit testing and write tests for API endpoints (CRUD, authentication).
- [ ] Write integration tests for frontend components to verify API interactions.
- [ ] Perform manual testing of user flows (login, upload, gallery filtering, form submission).
- [ ] Document any bugs or issues in a tracking sheet.
- [ ] Fix critical bugs identified during testing.

### Phase 9: Cross-Platform Testing and Optimization (Day 9)
- [ ] Test the website on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- [ ] Optimize images with TinyPNG or similar tools to reduce load times.
- [ ] Verify page load times are under 3 seconds using browser developer tools.
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation and ensure alt texts for images to improve accessibility.
- [ ] Fix any remaining bugs or performance issues from testing.

### Phase 10: Deployment and Launch (Day 10)
- [ ] Set up a Vercel account and configure the project for deployment.
- [ ] Purchase and configure a custom domain with SSL certification.
- [ ] Enable Cloudflare CDN for faster asset delivery.
- [ ] Deploy the application to production and verify all features.
- [ ] Set up Google Analytics to track visitor metrics.
- [ ] Perform a final manual test of the live site.
- [ ] Announce the launch on social media platforms.

## Notes
- **Task Management:** Use a tool like Trello, Notion, or a simple text file to track task completion.
- **AI Assistance:** Leverage AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to generate code, but manually review for accuracy, especially for security-critical components like authentication.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure tasks are completed in order, as later tasks depend on earlier ones (e.g., frontend relies on backend APIs).
- **Flexibility:** If a task takes longer than expected, split it across days or prioritize critical features to stay on schedule.
- **Documentation:** Update the README with setup, API, and deployment details as tasks are completed.

## Best Practices
- **Code Quality:** Follow consistent naming conventions and organize code into reusable components.
- **Version Control:** Commit changes after each task with descriptive messages (e.g., “Implemented photo upload API”).
- **Testing:** Test incrementally after each major feature to catch issues early.
- **Optimization:** Use lazy loading, image compression, and a CDN to ensure fast performance.
- **Security:** Verify HTTPS is enabled and sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is securely handled.
